# Focus Lock

Focus Lock is a simple browser extension built to help reduce distractions during focused work sessions.

The extension allows users to start a focus session for a custom duration and blocks common distracting websites during that time. YouTube is not fully blocked, but distracting elements like the home feed and Shorts are removed.

This project was created as a learning exercise to understand how browser extensions work, including background scripts, content scripts, and basic UI handling.
